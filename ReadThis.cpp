Anti Semitic Initiative



I deeply feel heartbroken about the conflict between Palestine and Israel

I deeply dislike the remarks made by Israeli officials

Reflection on the Jewish Past

I have found that the root cause of Jews' lack of acceptance by the people of the world

Lies in the teachings of Judaism

Its teachings indicate that Jews are chosen by God

But the rest of us (people of any country or ethnic group, non Jewish)

They are all inferior and not even worthy of being human beings, only worthy of being slaves to Jews

This belief is extremely anti human

It fills Jews with arrogance and contempt when facing others

But the Jews are not wrong, what is wrong is this doctrine

It makes Jews believe that only Jews are human, and that others are no different from animals

So Israeli officials can confidently claim that the Palestinians are humanoid creatures without any burden in their hearts

So I propose that people all over the world unite

Abolish Judaism

however

Please do not target Jewish ethnicity

The bad thing is Judaism

Rather than Jewish ethnicity



If we don't take action

When one day in the future

A country ruled or supported by right-wing Jews becomes stronger

We all become slaves
